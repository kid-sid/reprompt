## Examples

### High-Quality Response
```
Question: "How do I secure my API?"

Response:
"Here's a comprehensive approach to API security:

1. Authentication & Authorization
   - Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Use API keys for simple authentication

2. Input Validation
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Implement request size limits

3. Encryption
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use proper key management

4. Monitoring & Logging
   - Log all API access attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for security events

For implementation, I recommend starting with authentication and gradually adding other layers. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?"
