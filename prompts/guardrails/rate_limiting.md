# Rate Limiting Guardrails

## Purpose
This file defines rate limiting and abuse prevention measures to ensure fair usage and system stability.

## Rate Limiting Categories

### User-Based Limits
- **Requests per Minute**: Limit individual user requests
- **Requests per Hour**: Prevent sustained abuse
- **Requests per Day**: Control daily usage patterns
- **Concurrent Requests**: Limit simultaneous processing

### Content-Based Limits
- **Token Limits**: Maximum tokens per request
- **Request Size**: Maximum input length
- **Response Size**: Maximum output length
- **Processing Time**: Maximum processing duration

### System-Based Limits
- **Global Throughput**: System-wide request limits
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and storage limits
- **API Quotas**: Third-party service limits
- **Cost Controls**: Budget and spending limits

## Rate Limiting Rules

### Standard Limits
- **Free Tier**: 10 requests/minute, 100 requests/hour
- **Basic Tier**: 30 requests/minute, 500 requests/hour
- **Premium Tier**: 100 requests/minute, 2000 requests/hour
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits based on agreement

### Content Limits
- **Input Length**: Maximum 10,000 characters
- **Output Length**: Maximum 5,000 characters
- **Processing Time**: Maximum 30 seconds
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB for uploads

### Abuse Prevention
- **Burst Protection**: Allow short bursts within limits
- **Gradual Backoff**: Increase delays for repeated violations
- **Temporary Blocks**: Short-term blocks for abuse
- **Permanent Blocks**: Long-term blocks for severe abuse

## Response Strategies

### Rate Limit Exceeded
```
You've reached your rate limit of [X] requests per [time period]. 
Please wait [time] before making another request.

Your limit will reset at [time]. Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits.
```

### Content Too Large
```
Your request exceeds the maximum size limit of [X] characters. 
Please reduce the length of your input and try again.

For longer content, consider breaking it into smaller requests.
```

### Processing Timeout
```
Your request is taking longer than expected to process. 
This may be due to complexity or system load.

Please try again with a simpler request or try again later.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Monitoring
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor usage in real-time
- **Historical Analysis**: Track usage patterns over time
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual usage patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Track system performance impact

### Enforcement
- **Soft Limits**: Warnings before hard limits
- **Hard Limits**: Strict enforcement of boundaries
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce quality before blocking
- **Emergency Measures**: Circuit breakers for system protection

### User Experience
- **Clear Communication**: Explain limits and timing
- **Helpful Guidance**: Suggest alternatives or optimizations
- **Progress Indicators**: Show remaining quota
- **Upgrade Options**: Present upgrade paths

## Abuse Detection

### Patterns to Monitor
- **Rapid Requests**: Unusually high request frequency
- **Large Requests**: Consistently large input sizes
- **Automated Behavior**: Non-human usage patterns
- **Resource Consumption**: Excessive system resource usage

### Response Actions
- **Warning**: First violation gets a warning
- **Throttling**: Slow down requests for repeat offenders
- **Temporary Block**: Short-term access restriction
- **Permanent Block**: Long-term or permanent restriction

## Quality Assurance

### Fair Usage
- **Equal Access**: Ensure fair access for all users
- **Priority Handling**: Handle legitimate users first
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute resources fairly
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about limits

### System Stability
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across systems
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent system overload
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain service during high load
- **Recovery Procedures**: Quick recovery from issues

## Examples

### Rate Limit Responses
```
User makes 11th request in 1 minute (limit: 10/minute)
Response: "Rate limit exceeded. You can make 10 requests per minute. 
Please wait 45 seconds before your next request."

User makes request with 15,000 characters (limit: 10,000)
Response: "Request too large. Maximum input length is 10,000 characters. 
Your input is 15,000 characters. Please reduce by 5,000 characters."
```

### Abuse Prevention
```
User makes 50 requests in 1 minute (suspicious pattern)
Response: "Unusual activity detected. Your account has been temporarily 
throttled. Please wait 5 minutes before making another request."

User consistently makes large requests (resource abuse)
Response: "Resource usage limit exceeded. Please reduce request size 
or contact support for assistance with large requests."
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics
- **Request Volume**: Total requests per time period
- **Response Times**: Average and peak response times
- **Error Rates**: Rate of failed or blocked requests
- **User Satisfaction**: User feedback and complaints

### Alert Conditions
- **High Volume**: Unusual spike in requests
- **Slow Response**: Response times above threshold
- **High Error Rate**: Error rate above normal
- **System Load**: Resource usage above capacity

### Response Procedures
- **Automatic Scaling**: Scale resources automatically
- **Manual Intervention**: Human oversight when needed
- **User Communication**: Inform users of issues
- **Recovery Actions**: Steps to restore normal service
